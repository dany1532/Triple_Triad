# Triple_Triad

FF8: Triple Triad is a GUI-based clone of the popular card game in Final Fantasy VIII. It was developed using NetBeans IDE and programmed in Java.

For this individual project I wanted to recreate the feel of my favorite mini game in FF8. I used Java's Swing components to create the GUI aspects of the game and keyboard inputs to play the game. Some of the specifications of the project was to create an offline and a server/client networking model versions of the game.
